This program is a simple module example for SpEdito.

It generates an assembly output file. It needs an output file name: keep
this in mind while you are configuring it in the Module Manager.

This program is distributed with source code under the terms of the GNU
GPL License version 2, with the hope that the source code is useful for
people who want to extend SpEdito by writing modules.

This program is written in ANSI C, thus it should be highly portable on
a large number of operating systems.
