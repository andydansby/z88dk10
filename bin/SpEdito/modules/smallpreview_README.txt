This program is a simple module example for SpEdito.

It shows a small preview of the sprite (2x2 real pixels block for each
sprite pixel). It does not need output file name, since the only output
is the preview window: keep this in mind while you are configuring it
in the Module Manager.

This program is distributed with source code under the terms of the GNU
GPL License version 2, with the hope that the source code is useful for
people who want to extend SpEdito by writing modules.

This program uses the FLTK library, version 1.1.x (http://www.fltk.org)
and standard C++; thus it can compile under Windows, Linux, MacOS and
other systems.
